      We have been working with Agiliq Solutions as an IT partner for the past year, and we are delighted with their performance. They are both extremely capable and extremely professional. When our goals and directions are unclear or when they see a better solution, they are quick to let us know. Then, once we have agreed on specifics and timing, they get it done within budget and on schedule. We look forward to continuing to work with them in the years to come.

      Shabda and his team at Agiliq have been superb partners on a very complicated django project featuring celery, redis, django templates, REST APIs, Stripe integration, push notifications, and more. Shabda is easy to work with and he has made excellent recommendations on how to solve different problems from both a process and technology perspectives. I have been extremely impressed with the technical proficiency, teamwork, and communication from Shabda and his team. I look forward to a long relationship with Shabda and Agiliq.

      "In the startup world, we’re seeing a dearth of technical co-founders in an environment where proving traction is required to raise capital and recruit talent. For non-technical founders, this presents an interesting conundrum. We need technical help to build our web and mobile technology products - but we can't find technical people.
      Enter Shabda and his crack crew of amazing developers. I strongly recommend that you hire him and his team to be your technical arm if you're a non-technical founder. He has helped us build our most successful app."

## Why GraphQL ?

* To avoid multiple versioning of your rest API.
* Ask for what you need: Client has a provision to ask only those fields which they needs. There would be no handling on server side specific to the platform.
* Avoid multiple API calls to get the related data. GraphQL allows us to get the related data in a single request.
* Speed up the application performance.

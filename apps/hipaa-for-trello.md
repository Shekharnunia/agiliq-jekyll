# HIPAA for Trello

## What is HIPAA Law?
HIPAA is the acronym for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. It does the following:

* Requires the protection and confidential handling of protected health information
* Provides the ability to transfer and continue health insurance coverage for millions of American workers and their families when they change or lose their jobs
* Reduces health care fraud and abuse
* Mandates industry-wide standards for health care information on electronic billing and other processes

## Why HIPAA for Trello?
As of today, Trello doesn't support HIPAA Law, so the engineers at Agiliq have developed extensions for Google Chrome/Mozilla FireFox, enabling not only doctors, but all the users in Healthcare Industry to use Trello.

## How do we guarantee HIPAA applicability?

All the generated card data is stored in Google's Databases, and trello server just stores the ID which represents the data from the database. 

When a user navigates to Trello, their data will be loaded from google's databases and represented in the form of Card Names, rather than some IDs

When a user creates a new card, the card data is saved in google's databases, and a unique ID is stored at Trello. Same is applicable even during update, but just that the ID at Trello will still be the same, just that the actual card data will be modified.

# HIPAA for Trello

## What is HIPAA Law?
HIPAA is the acronym for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. It does the following:

* Requires the protection and confidential handling of protected health information
* Provides the ability to transfer and continue health insurance coverage for millions of American workers and their families when they change or lose their jobs
* Reduces health care fraud and abuse
* Mandates industry-wide standards for health care information on electronic billing and other processes

## Why HIPAA for Trello?
As of today, Trello doesn't support HIPAA Law, so the engineers at Agiliq have developed an extensions for Google Chrome and Mozilla FireFox, enabling doctors and all the users in Healthcare Industry to use Trello.
